ITIL based Incident, Change and Project Management - TEST ONLY

This is an early test and is likely to be aweful.

The plan is to have a 1 page for all running on ruby on rails app with mariaDB backend.
Also will hopefully have a docker cluster option available too.

Will have to see how badly this goes :)
